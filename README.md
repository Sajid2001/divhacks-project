# Cost Minus
A revolutionary pharmacy app that provides affordable access to prescription drugs.

## üí° Inspiration
The problem with prescription drugs costing too much lies in its impact on accessibility and affordability of healthcare. High drug prices can lead to financial burdens on patients, forcing some to forgo essential medications, potentially worsening their health. Additionally, it strains healthcare systems and insurance providers, increasing overall healthcare costs. Exorbitant drug prices often result from complex factors like patents, lack of competition, and opaque pricing structures, making it challenging to address the issue effectively. Addressing the high cost of prescription drugs is crucial to ensure equitable access to healthcare and to alleviate the financial stress on individuals and healthcare systems alike.

## üíß What it does
First and foremost, our invention aims to significantly reduce the cost of medication for consumers, making healthcare more affordable and accessible. Generic drugs are often cheaper than their brand-name counterparts but are required to meet the same safety and efficacy standards. This can save patients and healthcare systems money, potentially improving overall public health. Additionally, the availability of generic options can foster competition in the pharmaceutical market, putting pressure on brand-name drug prices to become more competitive, further benefiting consumers and the healthcare system as a whole.

## üíª How we built it
We all had the most experience in full stack development, making us lean towards using Javascript for the front and backend. For the frontend, we utilized React to create the components and for the backend, we utilized Express. Our database is built using MongoDB Atlas, and we retrieved our data for the demo from country-wide prescription drug pricing databases.

## ‚è≥ Challenges we ran into
One of our main challenges was getting comfortable with using creating a UI so quickly. Most of our team had never been to a Hacakthon before, so there was a learning curve involved in getting comfortable creating the site quickly, and figuring out what would be feasible given the time restraints. Overall we're super proud of how we fared with this enw challenge.

## ‚úÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're very proud of the fact that we learned and developed quickly in a language quite unfamiliar to us. And, of course, we're proud of the aesthetics of the virtual aquarium of the app--a visual representation of a user's current water usage relative to other users.

## ü§î What we learned
We learned how challenging, yet important, it is to determine early on how the features of an application connect to one another, and how to effectively integrate the backend to the frontend. By answering these questions upfront, we can focus on implementation and logic. Finally, we learned how teamwork and constant collaboration in software design and development doesn't simply improve efficiency, but it allows us to ideate and develop products better than we could have ever imagined.

## üåä What's next for koi
Better features, and more features. We want to continue to clean & develop our code. The next feature we're most excited about is introducing a social aspect to the app with a Friends page. Each user can view their friends' aquariums and see how their performance compares, providing further incentive to log their stats and improve their water usage over time. Beyond that, we want to keep working on ways to make koi more fun! One idea we had was to make the aquarium dynamic and customizable, with moving sea life and an option to buy new creatures using an in-app currency earned by completing the daily survey and reducing your water usage.
