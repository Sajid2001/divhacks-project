# Cost Minus Drugs
## A revolutionary pharmacy app that provides affordable access to prescription drugs.

## üí° Inspiration
The problem with prescription drugs costing too much lies in its impact on accessibility and affordability of healthcare. High drug prices can lead to financial burdens on patients, forcing some to forgo essential medications, potentially worsening their health. Additionally, it strains healthcare systems and insurance providers, increasing overall healthcare costs. Exorbitant drug prices often result from complex factors like patents, lack of competition, and opaque pricing structures, making it challenging to address the issue effectively. Addressing the high cost of prescription drugs is crucial to ensure equitable access to healthcare and to alleviate the financial stress on individuals and healthcare systems alike.

## üíß What it does
First and foremost, our invention aims to significantly reduce the cost of medication for consumers, making healthcare more affordable and accessible. Generic drugs are often cheaper than their brand-name counterparts but are required to meet the same safety and efficacy standards. This can save patients and healthcare systems money, potentially improving overall public health. Additionally, the availability of generic options can foster competition in the pharmaceutical market, putting pressure on brand-name drug prices to become more competitive, further benefiting consumers and the healthcare system as a whole.

## üíª How we built it
We all had the most experience in full stack development, making us lean towards using Javascript for the front and backend. For the frontend, we utilized React to create the components and for the backend, we utilized Express. Our database is built using MongoDB Atlas, and we retrieved our data for the demo from country-wide prescription drug pricing databases.

## ‚è≥ Challenges we ran into
One of our main challenges was getting comfortable with using creating a UI so quickly. Most of our team had never been to a Hacakthon before, so there was a learning curve involved in getting comfortable creating the site quickly, and figuring out what would be feasible given the time restraints. Overall we're super proud of how we fared with this enw challenge.

## ‚úÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're very happy with the website that we created. The research we did in creating it was probably the most rewarding part of the processs because we know that with the proper data (much of which is difficult to obtain), the site can become operationalized and millions of people will benefit.
